*Mabinogi Database*

I needed something to sharpen up my web application developement skills, and remind my self how to framework development and design. This is a custom framework designed for a site I wrote, "Mabinogi Database". Which is a database driven collection of Applications that are designed to be tools to help players of the game.

As you can see I focused on designing a LAPP stack. (Linux, Apache, PostGreSQL and PHP) With this stack I designed a some what MVC (more View / Controller driven) stack. The views are loaded and using the API, data is collected from controllers, which use an abstracted model to pull data from the database. 

I hope this will also be useful to anyone else out there to learn a bit about this stuff.
